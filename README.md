# OSA-Yith-Mk3
The Yith is a 8 gun meta fighter seeing multiple changes over patches to Starbase. The Mk3 is an evolution to apply better counters to high end weapons. Comes in autocannon, laser and plasma variants.


//Specs//


8 mounted weapons with a staggered fire trigger system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Rapidfire button switches between staggered fire (gun 2 will stagger behind gun 1 creating a machine gun effect) and alpha strike (both guns fire together).

BoostMin and BoostMax act as a aim keybind without yolo (yolo is avoided where possible due to the 0.2 delay) these should ALWAYS be bound to the same key.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

This can be altered to be the more common method of aiming, having higher sense as standard, and having the ships pitch/yaw slow down for aiming.
(Swap the BoostMin/BoostMax Off values with its On values, remember to set it in the pitch/yaw lever fields too)

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Its primarlily plated using a char core with alloys across the front face of the ship, alloys are on the second side/rear armour.

132 m/s max speed using T2 thrusters.

2187055.25 kg in weight.

Two small prop tanks for 2 million prop, 40 mins estimated flight time.

2 T1 fuel chamber, 6 T1 generators, 6 T1 enhancers, 1 hour 10 mins estimated fight time

Uses basic FCU, no reverse, uses 2 MFC/FCU groups, still issolates roll from main thruster pack for fast turning, no need to rebind roll keys.

Entry is through a small gap on both sides of the glass, and bellow through the fake cockpit plating, exit ship by looking bottom left at a exit seat.

//History//


The Mk1 started as a cheap 4 gun fighter made to replace my current meta ship that was nerfed by the headglitch fix.

It was cheap, and fun, but i found my self getting destroyed by a growing size creap of meta fighters i was fighting.

And so with the Mk2 i aimed to double the size and scope of the ship to match, with a secondary goal of replacing the then ageing Metabus.

The Mk2 is to this day my most battle tested fighter i have ever designed, going even beyond the first Migo.

The ship is designed to put as much voxel armour on the prow of the ship, and have a massive big plate core to catch stray shots.

Then came the buff to plasmas, and the introduction of railguns to live, and while the Mk2 held itself well in the face of better weapons, it lacked the countermeasure developed since.

The Mk3 is the result, an attempt to keep the same battle tested hull, and add additional plating to make it less min maxed to counter autoguns/lasers.


//Tactics//


This ship is a brawler to its core, and the new counter plating makes crippiling strikes to its flanks harder to do.

8 guns are in my oppinion, the most vital gun config a PvP player/corp needs to contend, for it is the point where even the largest plates are shredded in quck salvos.

It is also the edge of affordibility, past the 8 gun size, it holds less value to go cheap, as the cost of a large ship warrent a increase of higher teir coomponents and late game weapons.

The 8 gun is the default fleet ship in small to large battles, large enough that any size ship must respect its damage, but being deadly to anything smaller.

It is paramaount that you addopt a more aggresive combat style for larger ships, you are packing heat, your job is to hit the most vital targets on the field, and kill them.

Evasion is way less important in a ship of size, reserved only for collisions and the largest of ships targeting you.

Focus fire between two 8 gun ships is devistating, it very quickly begins to add up, well executed focus fire can bring down even the biggest of ships (like VIR's Borg Cube)

My combat expirence has shown me that running fighters in at least pairs is incredibly effective, focus firing on two ships that match is tricky, and can increase the survival rate of ships in fleet fights.

The Yith is made for this, it has cheap autogun versions that can be built on mass, and more expensive versions will look exactly the same as the cheap, they wont be able to focus the plasma until its too late.

Engage targets in a sideways orbit, this keeps your thickest voxel armour facing your target, and presents the slimmest dimensions to aim at.


//Design//


This ship is made to compromise as little as possible in the method or armouring i know.

Armour is front facing to survive orbit fights, this ship should have a great advantage against other ships of its class, can tank larger ships as well.

Side, top, bottom and thruster plates are made of the largest possible, to increase the "Magic Health" of the plates.

Large triangle plates are used as much as possible due to them having great performance againts all mounted weapons, pound for pound best all round plate.

Front of the ship is composed of stacked large plates, made of char, that surround the guns and is the core armour located at the front.

As well as having high magic health, the direction the plates are stacked to take advantage of the voxel damage system.

When a plates health is broken, it will begin taking voxel damage, by stacking the plates lenghtways you ensure the projectile must pass through as much material as possible.

Plates (even small plates) can resist multiple rounds on top of there magic health, if the plate is broken but still on the ship, it wil continue to provide some protection.

This method is best against lasers, as magic health is quickly destroyed by laser weapons and above.

It is also segmented, meaning that that the damage will be spread accross mutiple plates instaed of one, reducing the chance of well aimed burst penertrating your armour.

Surrounding this voxel armour are more large triangles, to cover up the angles the voxel plates will not apply it effects.

Along the very prow of the ship are bastonium railings, this is sacrifice plating to assorb damage from plasma/railguns.

Unlike lasers, plasma and railguns excell at breaking large plate health AND voxel armour, while lacking crit chance on explosive components.

Without sacrifice plating, it is only a matter of time before you armour is gone and your ship is rendered unflyable.

Where plasma/rails do not do well against is ironicaly, small plates, as the shatter damage dealt struggles to spread from plate to plate.

This means using smaller plates on the outer layer is in fact a great technique, and can protect your core armour from deadly alpha strikes with late game weapons.

These plates still help with lower tier weapon fire.

This ship has autocannon, laser and plasma versions, i consider higher tier weapons to hold less value on smaller ships vs big, so use to your taste.

This ship is not max speed as it would require a massive nerf to the voxel armour, leaving the ship vulnrable to lasers, i encourage expirementing with the plate mats.
